# Tool-Bar-10-day-Challenge

Build a toolbar like you see on many websites that have the title of the site and navigation links. The title of the site will be passed into the component, and the site links will be nested within it. The title should be on the left side and 3-4 links should go on the right side. You can use popular sites like Google or Gmail for the links. For this challenge, you’ll use ng-content and @Input().
